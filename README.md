# Syllabus
We developed a way to easily teach students the significant patterns to build upon and eventually practice independently without the mental heap required to understand these interview-level questions that our industry asks. 

Every subject is explained through problem-solving and templating the significant pieces to develop speed and understanding. 

This eight-week Immersive will cover the most common patterns and modifications on each topic weekly every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 5:30 PST to 8:30 PST / 8:30 pm EST to 11:30 pm EST.


We would review all the modifications and sub-patterns for each category and build a template from intuition.

# How each class would work
DSA questions are like an art form. Once you master the common patterns, you build your catalog of templates; then it comes to the problem-solving part. This course will teach you each pattern and template and explain how to use it for problem-solving.

We would have 22 classes, and it  will go as follows: 
- 5-minute introduction to the topic
- 30-minute pattern review 
- 30-minute peer interview exchange
- 10-minute break 
- 30-minute pattern review 
- 30-minute peer interview exchange 
- 5-minute wrap up of the day
